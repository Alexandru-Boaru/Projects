Project: Regex Engine

  Written in Python, using ANTLR for parsing the regex
  The program receives a regex expression and a text file that contains one word per line as inputs. For the words that match with the regex it will print true, otherwise it will print false.
  First use make in order to create necessary files for parsing
  To run:
    python main.py RAW <regex> <input_file.txt>
    <regex> must be given as string (ex: ”(a(..)∗a)|(.∗0)”)
