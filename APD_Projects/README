Project 1: Fourier and Fast Fourier Transform using threads
  Written in C, must be compiled with:
    gcc homeworkFT.c -o homeworkFT -lm -pthread
    gcc homeworkFFT.c -o homeworkFFT -lm -pthread
  It works for 1, 2 or 4 threads
  To run:
    ./homeworkFT inputValues.txt outputValues.txt numThreads
    ./homeworkFFT inputValues.txt outputValues.txt numThreads

Project 2: Space Explorers and Federation HQ (bidirectional communication using threads)
  Written in Java (using Netbeans IDE)
  Implementation of a channel that stores messages from space explorers and from federation hq and send them from one another in order to explore all galaxies (nodes of a graph). The implementation is based on the Producer-Consumer problem
  To run:
     java Homework <wormHoles> <hashCount> <federationHQCount> <spaceExplorerCount>
    

Project 3: Image Processing with MPI
  Written in C, using MPI
  A program which can apply a series of filters (smooth, blur, emboss, mean, sharpen) to images formatted as PGM or PNM
  To compile use make
  To run:
     mpirun -np N ./tema3 image_in.pnm image_out.pnm filter1 filter2 ... filterX
